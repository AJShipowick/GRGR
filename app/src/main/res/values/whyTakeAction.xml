        <i>  *You\'re a red blooded American.</i>  You have rights, our representatives should carry out our wishes.  They should be held accountable for their actions.  It is our duty as Americans to let our representatives know where we stand on issues.\n
        <i>  *Our land is blessed.</i>  There is no denying we live in a great place in time.  We have inherited a majestic country and it is our duty to protect it.\n
        <i>  *We must hold our local representatives accountable.</i>  Our politicians have many influences on them.  It is our right to tell them what\'s on our mind.  And if they want to stay in office, they best listen.\n
        <i>  *Our forefathers knew best.</i>  Many lives have been lost to give us what we have today.  We must not forget that.  We must voice our opinion on foolish legislation.  We must make our voices heard.  Our rights don\'t change because of tragic events.\n
        <i>  *We want to do the right thing.</i>  We want to follow laws and be good citizens.  I hope there is never a time when we must break the law just to protect ourselves.  The more pressure we put on our representatives, the better chance we have of shooting down foolish un-constitutional legislation.\n
        <i>  *Take action today.</i>  Contact your local representatives through this app.  Demand they listen and demand they uphold their oath of office to defend and protect the Constitution.\n
